description: Welcome to Metro Government???s Open Data Portal. As part of Nashville???s
  Open Data Initiative, this site is the destination for the public to access Metro
  Government data in a new way. My signing of the Metro Nashville Open Data Executive
  Order outlines my belief that by pushing datasets out, Metro departments and agencies
  empower the public to partner with Metro Government. Through this site, we aim to
  co-create with civic technologists innovative web resources, insightful analytics
  on public programs and services, and new civic apps for the community. Visit us
  often for updates. I look forward to seeing where our community???s creativity and
  exploration of open data will take us.
